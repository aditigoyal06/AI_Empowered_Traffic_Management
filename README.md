# AI_Empowered_Traffic_Management
  **AI empowered traffic management aims aims to optimize traffic flow, improve safety, and encourage compliance with road safety regulations. We use Python , Pytorch , Yolo, OpenCV , pygame**
_It focuses on enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency by using AI to detect pedestrians waiting to cross the road and adjusting signal timings based on their numbers. The system also analyzes whether pedestrians are following safety rules, such as wearing helmets. Additionally, it tracks vehicles that violate safety rules, recording their vehicle numbers for further action._
**This project leverages artificial intelligence to enhance traffic management and road safety. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time pedestrian and vehicle analysis. It also enforces safety rules by detecting helmet usage and identifying violators.**

**Key Features**
> **Smart Traffic Signal Control:** Detects the number of pedestrians waiting at a crossing and adjusts signal timings accordingly to optimize traffic flow.

**Helmet and Safety Rule Detection:** Identifies whether motorcyclists are wearing helmets and following traffic rules.

**Violation Tracking:** Captures and stores vehicle numbers of those violating safety regulations for further action.

**Real-time Processing:** Uses YOLO for object detection and OpenCV for image processing to analyze traffic conditions in real time.

**Interactive Visualization:** Implements Pygame to simulate and visualize traffic control and pedestrian behavior.

**Technologies Used**

**Python:** It is the main programming language for implementation.

**PyTorch:** It is used for deep learning and model training.

**YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Real-time object detection for identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and helmets.

**OpenCV:** Image processing and computer vision tasks.

**Pygame:** Simulation and visualization of traffic scenarios.

**How It Works**
**Data Collection:** Camera feeds capture live traffic and pedestrian movement.

**Object Detection:** YOLO detects pedestrians, vehicles, and helmet usage.

**Traffic Signal Adjustment:** The system calculates pedestrian density and adjusts signal timing dynamically.

**Rule Enforcement:** If a motorcyclist is not wearing a helmet, their vehicle number is stored for further action.

**Simulation:** Pygame is used to create a visual representation of the system's decision-making process.

**Goals and Impact**
> _This project aims to:
> Improve pedestrian safety by giving them appropriate crossing time.
> Enforce road safety laws using AI-based monitoring. 
> Reduce traffic congestion through dynamic signal control.
> Provide authorities with data on traffic violations for better law enforcement._
